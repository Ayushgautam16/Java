// functional interface is defined as 

    // a functional interface has exactly one abstract method.

    // functional interfaces are used to define a contract between a class and its methods.

    // functional interfaces are useful when you want to use a lambda expression or method reference to implement a single abstract method.

// lambda interface 

    // a lambda interface is a functional interface that has exactly one abstract method.

    // lambda interfaces are used to create anonymous functions.

    // lambda interfaces can be used to define a contract between a class and its methods using lambda expressions or method references.
